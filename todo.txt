TODOS:

1. COLORS - Nicole 
-go through basically every css file and make sure there is no
bare color texts like "#39334". Make sure they are all imported from 
variable.scss as global variable.

2. HOME PAGE

-Button component - John
    -should take in text prop 

-Sidebar Scroll component (Collin got that) 
    -id2 website Redwood section 

-Each section component - David
    -each section will be mapped from json
    - should take in section title, and items in that section
    - this information will be provided from global variable

    -Product component  
        -each section should map the products within the section
        -takes in product information and displays items

    -Modal component
        -Modal should pop up on each item click
        -onClick each item should prop modal with that product customization information

-METHOD OF APPROACH:
    1. Collin works on sidebar scroll component
    2. Someone else works on UI for each section
        -this will be static for now (just do one section)
            -use fake data to get the products mapping and modal to pop up

3. About us - Nicole / John

-Top Info component
    -should be pretty simple, just make the top section into a component

-Bottom Info component
    -should also be simple, just make bottom section component


3. Cart - Collin or John

-Cart Product component
    -Collin made it pretty clean, just move each cart product into its own component so code is not so long
    
    -Quanitty Chooser component
        -the plus and minus thing should be another component

-The UI should look for every screen size 
    -rn it gets more scuffed narrower the screen gets

****
KEEP IN MIND WHILE DOING ANY OF YOUR WORK:
EVERYTHING (LITERALLY) THAT GOES ON THE WEBSITE THAT IS 
RESTAURANT SPECIFIC SHOULD ALL BE FROM A VARIABLE OR FROM A PROP 
NEVER WRITE DOWN RESTAURANT INFO STUFF IN PLAIN TEXT. 
WE WILL HAVE GLOBAL JSON VARIABLE FOR EVERYTHING SO FOR UI PURPOSES 
USE FAKE DATA, AND THEN AFTER UI IS DONE WE WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO 
INCORPORATE EVERYTHING USING GLOBAL JSON.
